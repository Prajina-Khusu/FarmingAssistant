It requires regular watering, especially during hot, dry weather, but excess water can cause disease problems. Spinach prefers partial shade but can tolerate full sun in cool climates. It is a relatively fast-growing crop that can be harvested in as little as four to six weeks from planting. Spinach is also a heavy feeder, so it is important to fertilize it regularly with a balanced fertilizer.     "]
